# Contributing
Before read this file please read the [README.md](https://github.com/reyadussalahin/problem_solving/blob/dev/README.md) file in project root.

You can contribute to this repository by:
- adding solutions to problems
- writing tutorials for those solutions
- writing tutorials for different problem solving techniques related data structures and algorithms.


## Process of Contribution
The process to contribute this repository may be summarized as follows:
1. You must have a github account to contribute to this project. You if don't have one, then please create one.
2. Create a fork of [problem_solving](https://github.com/reyadussalahin/problem_solving) repository.
3. Now, clone the forked repository which is under your account(the possible url may be - "https://github.com/{your_user_name}/problem_solving") into your local environment.
4. Create an "upstream" to the main project i.e. [problem_solving](https://github.com/reyadussalahin/problem_solving) using the command *"git remote add upstream https://github.com/reyadussalahin/problem_solving.git"*.
5. Pull all the changes from root project dev branch by using the command *git pull upstream dev* and merge the changes to your remote dev by using *"git push origin dev"*.
6. Now create a branch with the fix or changes with the name that you are doing. An example would be - if you are adding a solution for cf 233B problem, then give the branch name "add_cf233b".
7. Commit your changes in the new branch using *"git add file_name(s)"* and *"git commit -m commit_message"*. Replace file_name(s) with actual file names and commit_message with information about changes.
8. Push the branch with changes to your remote repository using the command *git push origin branch_name*. Considering step(7) the "branch_name" would be replaced by "add_cf233B".
9. Go to your remote repository and send a pull request to the root project repository.
10. Always perform step(5) before creating any new branch for contribution and always try to pull the latest changes done in root repository's dev branch.


## Rules for contribution
1. A new branch should contain only one fix, or one solution, or one tutorial, or one tutorial fix etc. **But never more than one.**
2. To do another contribution, please use another branch.
3. Make your dev branch always up to date with the root projects dev branch.
4. Never contribute to the master branch. It would never be accepted.
